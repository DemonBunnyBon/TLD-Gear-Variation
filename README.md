# Gear Variation

A mod adding more tool/gear variants for The Long Dark.

All of the items have unique statistics and looks, you might find them more or less often around the world, some of them are unique and only spawn in one specific location.

Not all of the variants are made to be better than the regular counterparts, but some of them might be easier to find.

With craftable tools the mod aims to give the game a bit of tool progression, so that you're not stuck without a knife or hammer on harder difficulties.
