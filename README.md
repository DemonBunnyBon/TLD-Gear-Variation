# Item Locations

- Some of the items are craftable, but all of the items have some sort of spawns, some are more common than others.

- Carpenter's Axe, Bird Statue and Craftsman's Hacksaw have specific spawn points.

- Other items, such as the splitting axe and mountaineer's sleeping bag can be found in many places around a vast selection of regions, so look out for them! (THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED)

- While the craftable items have some spawn spots, they are usually very very rare, this is intended.

<Summary>(Spoiler) Locations for unique items </Summary>

- Carpenter's Axe and Bird Statue are both found in the cabin with rim grill in Bleak Inlet.


- Craftsman's Hacksaw is found at the workbench in Hibernia Processing.

# Note
