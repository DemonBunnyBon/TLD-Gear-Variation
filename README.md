# TLD-Gear-Variation
A mod adding more tool/gear variations for The Long Dark.

# About

Currently the mod adds 6 new tool/gear variants, those include:

- An axe
- 2 knives
- 2 sleeping bags
- a hammer

Most of those are craftable, but all of the items have spawns, some are more common than others.
I might add more items in the future.

# Installation

This mod requires Modders Gear Toolbox by Jods and ModComponent, and all of their respective dependencies.
After installing those, download GearVariation.modcomponent from the releases page and drop it into your mods folder.

Have fun :)
