# TLD-Gear-Variation
A mod adding more tool/gear variants for The Long Dark.

# About

Currently the mod adds 8 new tool/gear variants (+ a little collectible), those include:

- Two Axes: Splitting Axe and Carpenter's Axe 

(GEAR_BigChoppingAxe, GEAR_CarpenterAxe)

- 2 Knives: Flint Knife and Bone Knife 

(GEAR_FlintKnife, GEAR_BoneKnife)

- 2 Sleeping Bags: Deerskin Sleeping Bag and Mountaineer's Sleeping Bag 

(GEAR_DeerSleepingBag, GEAR_TrekSleepingBag)

- A Hammer: Stone Hammer

(GEAR_StoneHammer)

- A Hacksaw: Craftsman's Hacksaw

(GEAR_HacksawLight)

- One Small Collectible: Little- Bird Statue

(GEAR_SmallBirdStatueColor)

# Note
Some of the items are craftable, but all of the items have some sort of spawns, some are more common than others.
Carpenter's Axe, Bird Statue and Craftsman's Hacksaw only spawn in one specific spot.
Some of the craftable items are intended for early game use, as sort of a tool progression.

I might add more items in the future.

# Installation

This mod requires Modders Gear Toolbox by Jods and ModComponent, and by that all of their dependencies.
After installing those, download GearVariation.modcomponent from the releases page and drop it into your mods folder.

Have fun :)
