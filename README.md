# TLD-Gear-Variation
A mod adding more tool/gear variants for The Long Dark.

# About

Currently the mod adds 6 new tool/gear variants, those include:

- An Axe: Splitting Axe 

(GEAR_BigChoppingAxe)

- 2 Knives: Flint Knife and Bone Knife 

(GEAR_FlintKnife,GEAR_BoneKnife)

- 2 Sleeping Bags: Deerskin Sleeping Bag and Mountaineer's Sleeping Bag 

(GEAR_DeerSleepingBag,GEAR_TrekSleepingBag)

- A Hammer: Stone Hammer

(GEAR_StoneHammer)

Most of those are craftable, but all of the items have spawns, some are more common than others. 
Some of the items are intended for early game use, as sort of a tool progression.
I might add more items in the future.

# Installation

This mod requires Modders Gear Toolbox by Jods and ModComponent, and by that all of their dependencies.
After installing those, download GearVariation.modcomponent from the releases page and drop it into your mods folder.

Have fun :)
